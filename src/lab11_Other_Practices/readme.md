## Task 1
Implement a recursive algorithm to find factorial of n.
 
## Task 2
Implement a recursive algorithm to find the n-th Fibonacci number
 
## Task 3
Implement a recursive algorithm of Binary search. (Input a sorted array)
 
## Task 4
Implement a recursive algorithm that takes a decimal number n and converts n to its corresponding binary number.
 
## Task 5
Implement a recursive algorithm which return the index of an element, given the value for a non-dummy headed singly linked sequential list. It will return -1 if the value is not found in the Linked List. Note: you’ll need a Singly Node class for this code.
 
## Task 6
Implement a recursive algorithm to find the m^n (m raised to the power n) in a linear fashion [linear recursive].
 
## Task 7
Implement a recursive algorithm to find the m^n (m raised to the power n) by dividing the problem into two equal parts:
e.g.
m^n  =  m^(n/2) * m^(n/2)
or
m^n  =  m^(n/2) * m^(n/2) * m [if n is odd]
## Task 8
Implement a recursive algorithm to sort an array. (Hint, you may use another function that finds the minimum.) (or try recursive bubble sort)
 
## Task 9
Implement a recursive algorithm which returns a String that contains all the elements of a non-dummy headed singly linked sequential list in reversed order. 
Example: if the linked list contains 10, 20, 30 and 40, the method will return “40 30 20 10”.
Note: you’ll need a Singly Node class for this code.
